# top-landing-page
This landing page project is the culmination of CSS / HTML skills learned from TOP, primarily flexbox.

Misc Notes:
- Use of `<divs>`/classes vs their respective tags (semantics)
    - i.e. `<div class="header"> `vs `<header>`
    - Similarly, `class` vs `id` for css
        - Which is better practice?
- Percentage based value padding vs hard value
    - Consider how this affects mobile viewing/flex-stretch etc.
- `margin: 0 auto` - Centers
